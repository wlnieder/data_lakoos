Hello, here I show a straight way to get marketprices from cryptocurrencies on binance with the binanace-connector.

1. code_etl.py shows the code implemented in my AWS Lambda, to get daily marketiprices.
2. code_etl_historical.ipynb shows the code for Jupyter Notebook, which I used to get historical data (100 days ago).
